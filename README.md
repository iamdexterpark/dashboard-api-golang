Dear Community,

I wanted to take a moment to reflect on the journey of our "dashboard-api-golang" project, which started in 2020 as an ambitious undertaking to learn Go programming language and develop a manual API with **over 370 endpoints**. While the tenacity was commendable, the approach was questionable, and in hindsight, not sustainable in the long term.

As we continue to grow and learn, it's time to archive "dashboard-api-golang" project as it will no longer be maintained. However, we are excited to announce that a new chapter has begun!

During Cisco Live 2022 in Las Vegas, I spoke about our [network automation journey at Starbucks](https://newsroom.cisco.com/c/r/newsroom/en/us/a/y2022/m08/cisco-helps-starbucks-brew-up-efficiency-through-network-automation.html) and why declarative programming paradigms are critical to automating the full infrastructure lifecycle at scale. As a result, I made a commitment to work with Cisco Meraki to produce a version of the Go API client suitable for enterprise use.

I'm thrilled to introduce "dashboard-api-go," hosted in the official Meraki Repo, which is community-supported and different from the previous version. You can find the new repo at this link: [dashboard-api-go](https://github.com/meraki/dashboard-api-go).

I want to express my gratitude to all contributors for their support in developing and maintaining "dashboard-api-golang" over the years. We encourage you to continue your contributions to the new project, and we look forward to collaborating with you in the future.

Best regards,

Dexter Park
